## Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing to this webpage.
Whether it is to fix a typo, update a data entry, or overhaul the entire page, your help is much appreciated.
Having said that, there are some simple rules which we would like you to follow:
- Do not propose changes if you don't know what you're doing; when unsure, post an issue with a request/recommendation instead.
- If your change is minor (e.g., fixing a typo or updating/adding a data entry), feel free to submit it right away. If it's big, talk it through first (either in-person or by submitting an issue).
- Submit your changes through a pull request. This makes managing changes a lot cleaner/easier. Please make it clear what you changed and why, though.

## The project's architecture

The project is fairly straightforward as it's a static webpage.
In other words, it's only a front-end, so no databases, APIs, or any other nonsense.
